Electronic speed controllers are responsible for spinning the motors at the speed requested by the autopilot. Most ESCs need to be calibrated so that they know the minimum and maximum pwm values that the flight controller will send.

Normally the ESC Calibration procedure is as same as other flight controller. So just follow the instruction on ArduPilot website: [http://copter.ardupilot.com/wiki/esc-calibration/](http://copter.ardupilot.com/wiki/esc-calibration/)

Don't forget to setup the ArduPilot binary to automatically start on boot first.
